# LearnToCodeWebApp
An interactive web application with different lessons/fun activities to help people learn how to code in a new language, the different lessons will flow like a regular course (such as topics to be covered week to week like how you structure your course) and will save user data to an account they must create/log into and will be saved in a database. Activities such as entering code in for a specific question, coding to make something move on the screen or to sort a list, and conceptual activities like dragging bubbles around to sort a list how the algorithm would, etc.
